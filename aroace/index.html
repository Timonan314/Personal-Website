        <h1>"You can't be gay <i>and</i> aroace" - way too many people</h1>
        <h3>(this isn't neccesarally directed at you, its more just to exemplify why I'm making this page.)</h3>
        <h1>"Nuh Uh" - me :)</h1>
        Okay, so I get told this a lot, and its getting kinda annoying, and I have trouble explaing this stuff, so I'm just going to make this, and send the link to people when they ask :D <br>
        There are a few different reasons why one could identify with both of these labels, and I'll do through them here. <br>
        <ul>
            <li>aro-ace (Aromantic Asexual) is really just an umbrella term for <i>many</i> different sub identities</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1.1</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
